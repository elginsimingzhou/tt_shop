<h1 align="center"><b>🔥Shop Smarter with ShopSmart🔥</b></b></h1>
A few months ago, I was browsing TikTok Shop for a birthday gift for a close friend who, like me, loves collecting watches. I was hopeful that TikTok Shop, known for its vast array of creative and diverse products, would help me find something special. 

However, as I started my search, I quickly realized that the discovery process was not as seamless as I had hoped. The recommendations I received were not tailored to my specific needs and interests, making it challenging to find the perfect gift.

Frustrated, I spent hours scrolling through countless products, many of which were unrelated to what I was looking for. This experience made me think about how much easier and more enjoyable the process could be if the discovery mechanism were more personalized and efficient.

Presenting ShopSmart! A more intuitive, personalized shopping experience that can help users find exactly what they're looking for quickly and easily!

## 🌟STAR🌟
A. We implemented a new button named “star”. Users will be able to “star” videos that are of their interest and have products in the video or products similar to those in the video recommended to them in the tiktok shop. This provides a seamless shopping experience for users as their tiktok shop will be a direct representation of their personal interest.<br />

Watch duration will also impact interests in the product shown in the video. For example, if a user watches for at least 10 seconds, it would be deemed as only a slight interest in the product.
